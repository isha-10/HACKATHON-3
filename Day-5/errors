Testing, Error Handling, and Backend Refinement
In the final phase, I conducted rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs. This included testing user flows, payment integrations, and API responses. Error-handling mechanisms were implemented to improve reliability and provide a seamless user experience. I also refined backend integrations to optimize performance and ensure the website could handle high traffic efficiently. By the end of this phase, the website was polished and ready for deployment.
